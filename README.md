MyBatipse : Eclipse plugin for MyBatis
=======

[MyBatis](http://mybatis.org/) is a popular SQL Mapper framework.  
And __MyBatipse__ is an Eclipse plug-in which provids content assists and validations when editing MyBatis related files.

## Features

### XML Editor Enhancements
#### Auto-completion

- Mapper namespace : Calculated from the path.  
![autocomplete namespace](screen/ac-ns1.png)![autocomplete namespace](screen/ac-ns2.png)
- Java class/Type alias : Propose Java classes and Type Aliases (translucent icons). Camelcase match is supported. [1] [2]  
![autocomplete class](screen/ac-class.png) ![autocomplete class](screen/ac-class-cc.png)
- Java property : Propose properties of the parent java class. Nested properties are supported.  
![autocomplete property](screen/ac-prop1.png) ![autocomplete property](screen/ac-prop2.png)
- Statement ID : If corresponding mapper interface exists, propose the method name as a statement ID.  
![autocomplete statement id](screen/ac-stmt.png)
- Reference to resultMap/select/sql : Propose ID of the referenced resultMap/select/sql. External reference is supported (blue icons).  
![autocomplete reference](screen/ac-ref.png)
- Result elements in resultMap/collection/association : Generates <result /> elements for the parent java class properties.  
![autocomplete results 1](screen/ac-results1.png) ![autocomplete results 2](screen/ac-results2.png)

- __[1]__ For better performance, classes in the application libraries (loaded as JARs) are listed only when at least one package segment is specified.
- __[2]__ There is a limitation for the type alias support. Basically, if type aliases are registered using Java API, they are not automatically detected. As a workaround, you can register type aliases in MyBatipse's preference. See the _Configuration_ section.

#### Hyperlinks
- To referenced resultMap/select/sql element. External reference is supported.
- To mapper interface method.

#### Validation
- Missing TypeAlias, Java class/property.
- Missing resultMap/select/sql ID. 
- etc.

## Configuration

### MyBatis Nature
- By default, each file is validated when it's saved, but you would want to validate the XML mapper when the related Java classes are updated as well. For that purpose, MyBatipse provides a custom nature __MyBatis Nature__.  
To add the nature, right click the project in the package explorer and choose __Configure__ -> __Add MyBatis Nature__ from the menu.

### Type Alias
- Type alias are automatically detected _if_ they are registered using XML config file (both mybatis and mybatis-spring config is supported).  
If you register type aliases in Java code, MyBatipse cannot detect them. As a workaround, you can register custom type aliases in the project setting (Open __Project__ -> __Properties__ menu and select __MyBatipse__ from the left column).  
![type aliases](screen/pref-alias.png)   
For example, with the above settings: 
  - The first entry registers all the classes in ```com.example.domain``` package as type aliases.  
  - The second entry registers the single class ```domain.Person```.  
  - The third entry registers the single class ```domain.SomeLongNamedBean``` under the alias ```SomeBean```.
  - Note that, in any case, MyBatipse respects ```@Alias``` annotation if it exists.
